# Processing Arcade

This project is a collection of three games implemented in Processing and Java: Twenty Forty Eight, Wordle, and TicTacToe.

## Games

### Twenty Forty Eight

A classic sliding block puzzle game where the objective is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them and create a tile with the number 2048.

### Wordle

A word guessing game where the player has to guess a hidden word by proposing a series of five-letter words. The game provides feedback on the correctness of the guessed letters.

### TicTacToe

A simple and classic game of TicTacToe where the objective is to get three of your marks in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

## Running the Games

The games can be run from the `main.pde` file. The `mainMenu()` function provides a menu to select which game to play.

## Word Lists

The Wordle game uses a list of five-letter words, which is generated by the `SortWords` class in `SortWords.java`. This class reads a list of words from a file, filters out non-alphabetic words and words not of length 5, and saves them to a new file named "Fivers.txt".
